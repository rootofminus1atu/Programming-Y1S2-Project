# Programming-Y1S2-Project
This is my programming project for ATU Sligo. It consists of a C# console app and an (unfinished, additional) react app which both are supposed to analyze and display information from a CSV file representing the migration data from Ireland to the USA during the 19th century.

# The C# console app
The console app consists of 3 files:
- Main.cs - That's where most of the program happens, the data gets read in there, then sent to the other 2 files, processed and finally displayed with
- Passenger.cs - Here the data gets stored and processed with the help of a Passenger and Ship class
- Menu.cs - A simple Menu creator, to automate the process of creating menus.

# The React app
An additional challenge that hasn't been finished yet. To include data visualization. (I might use Next.js in the future)
